If you’re a fan of Animal Crossing or Night in the Woods you will definitely love this game as much as I do. You can reach the ending in around 2 hours, but there’s so much about this delightful game that will keep you coming back, even after you’ve finished the story. ",

Choose from (limited) pronouns, and the main rival in the game is even non-binary! (extra props: they ban transphobic players!) ",
